            <h2>Movie Details</h2>
            <p>The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, currently distributed by
            Warner Bros. Pictures. Widely considered to be one of the greatest films in cinema history,[5] it is the best-known and
            most commercially successful adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 children's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.[6] Directed
            primarily by Victor Fleming (who left production to take over the troubled production of Gone with the Wind), the film
            stars Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale alongside Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Frank Morgan, Billie Burke and Margaret
            Hamilton with Charley Grapewin, Pat Walshe, Clara Blandick, Terry (billed as Toto) and Singer's Midgets as the
            Munchkins</p>
            <p>Characterized by its legendary use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score and memorable characters, the
            film has become an icon of American popular culture. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture,
            but lost to Gone with the Wind, also directed by Victor Fleming. It did win in two other categories: Best Original Song
            for "Over the Rainbow" and Best Original Score by Herbert Stothart. While the film was considered a critical success
            upon release in August 1939, it failed to make a profit for MGM until the 1949 re-release, earning only $3,017,000 on a
            $2,777,000 budget, not including promotional costs, which made it MGM's most expensive production at that time.</p>

                <h2>Ruby Slippers</h2>
                <p>The ruby slippers are the magic pair of shoes worn by Dorothy Gale as played by Judy Garland in the 1939 MGM musical
                movie The Wizard of Oz. Because of their iconic stature,[1] the ruby slippers are among the most valuable items of film
                memorabilia.[2] A number of pairs were made for the film, though the exact number is unknown. Five pairs are known to
                have survived; one pair was stolen from a museum in 2005 and recovered in 2018</p>

                <h2>Toto</h2>
                <p>In the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz, Toto was played by a female brindle Cairn Terrier named Terry. She was paid a $125
                salary each week, which was more than some of the human actors (the Singer Midgets who played the Munchkins reportedly
                received $50 to $100 a week).</p>
